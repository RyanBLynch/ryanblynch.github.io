[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an open-source static site generator (SSG). It's a software tool for automatically generating template-based websites. I used Hugo with the [Dream Plus theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-dream-plus/), and mostly followed the recipe.

Sure, I'm a programmer. But I don't know shit about front-end coding (making websites). I made a simple site in high school (~1997), and then another one in college (~1999). Simple HTML is no problem, but CSS and JavaScript are Greek to me. In other words, I'm not really literate, but I can kinda sign my own name.

It took me about two hours to get this site up and running--including writing this post. I didn't really read the theme documentation, just the introduction and "getting started" bits.

There are a lot of how-to guides and tutorials for getting started with Hugo. Here's a suggestion that would have saved me ~30 minutes: When there's a conflict between some random tutorial and the theme docs, defer to the latter.

In terms of future plans, I have a couple of initial use-cases in mind:

- Past trip reports - descriptions, photos, links, maps, etc from completed hiking/climbing/etc outings.
- Future trip plans - descriptions, photos, links, maps, etc for upcoming outings.
- Projects - cool stuff I've made, that I'd like to share for others to use.
- Tutorials - descriptions of how I do things (e.g., composing paper map sets for field navigation).
- Rants, raves, and apologies - other thoughts about stuff

Anyway, if I were you, I wouldn't expect too much too soon :-)
